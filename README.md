# npm-ui

This is an electron app for visualising NPM cli commands. It aims to provide a view for running scripts defined in your package.json (as well as adding + removing scripts) and viewing/updating a projects dependencies. 

The initial idea of this project is credited to [Sunil Pai](https://github.com/threepointone)

This project is currently in its very early stages and is very much a WIP, PRs are welcome!

## Running development mode

1. `npm i .`
2. `npm run dev`

Currently, in development mode you can only see scripts that are located within this project itself (hopefully, [#7](https://github.com/alex-saunders/npm-ui/issues/7) fixes this in the near future).
